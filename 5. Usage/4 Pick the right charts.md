#### Bad Visualizations

Visualizations you shouldn't use (with a few exceptions):
- [[Pie chart]]
- [[Donut chart]]
- [[Gauge]]
- [[Sankey]]
- [[Radar chart]]
- [[Treemap]]
- [[Bubble chart]]
- [[Clustured Column chart]]

#### Chart Selection Diagram

**("bad vizualizations" are not removed)**

1. What would you like to show?
	- Comparison (most common)
		- [[Comparison Among Items]]
		- [[Comparison Over Time]]
	- Composition (most common)
		- [[Composition Static]]
		- [[Composition Changing over Time]]
	- [[Distribution]]
	- [[Relationship]]
2. How many variables do you want to show in a single chart?
	- One, two, three or many?
3. How many items (data points) will you display for each variable?
	- Only a few or many?
4. Will you display values over a period of time, or among items or groups?

#### Good Visualizations (Basic Users)

KPIs:
- [[Card with States]]


**COMPARISON**

Change or trend over time:
-  Small or Large
	- 1 measure: [[Line chart]] & [[Card with States]] & [[Sparkline]] (optional)
	- 3 - 10 measures: [[Line chart]] & [[Sparkline]] (optional)
- Significant
	- [[Bar chart]]

Compare exact, quantitative data from several categories:
- 2 - 7 categories and short category names: [[Column chart]]
- 7 - 15 categories or/and long category names: [[Bar chart]]

Up to four measures:
- [[Candlestick]]

Compare categories of stores (superscript):
- [[Stacked Bar chart]] / [[Stacked Column chart]]

Compare stores that are in categories (subscript):
- [[Clustured Bar chart]] / [[Clustured Column chart]]

Comparison, relationship and trends of variables on vastly different scales:
- [[Line and Clustured Column chart]]


**COMPOSITION**

Composition of the total amount through steps:
- Increasing and descreasing: [[Waterfall chart]]
- Increasing or descreasing: [[Column chart]]
- Contribution over years: [[Line chart]]

Composition of items:
- 2 - 3 items: [[Stacked Column chart]]

Composition of variables:
- 2 - 3 variables: [[Stacked Bar chart]]



Cumulative (Sales cost + Gross cost):
- [[Line chart]]


**DISTRIBUTION**

Population distribution by the age (and sex):
- [[Bar Histogram]]


**DISTRIBUTION and RELATIONSHIP**

Distribution and relationships of a single variable over a set of categories
- [[Column Histogram]]


**RELATIONSHIP**

Display quantitative information on a map:
- [[Map chart]]


**MIXED**

Comparison, composition or relationship analysis:
- Few variables and data points
	- [[Table]]

Compare or look up individual, precise values:
- [[Table]]

Zebra BI Visualizations can be used for bigger customers. It is too expensive for the smaller ones.
