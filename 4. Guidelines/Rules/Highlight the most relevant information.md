No need to highlight:
- Logo:
	- make it smaller
	- put it at the bottom
- Title:
	- no reason to be too large (text size: 18)
- Slicer:
	- [[Slicer Year]], [[Slicer Month]], [[Slicer Week]] without titles

Distribute elements by their importance:
- Left to right
	- E.g.: time (should be always on the horizontal axis)
- Top to down
