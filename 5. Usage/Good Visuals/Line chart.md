Guidelines:
- Do not skip values for consistent data intervals presenting trend information (e.g.: certain days with zero values)
- Use a proper aspect ratio (45 degree) to show important information and avoid dramatic slope effects

- Visualizations -> Analytics -> Min line + Max line + Median line
