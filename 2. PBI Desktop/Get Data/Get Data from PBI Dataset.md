Power BI Desktop -> Home -> Get data
- Power BI datasets (to connect with Power BI service)
- Connect to the dataset uploaded into Power BI service -> Create

Better than copying PBI file from one Workspace to another Workspace

If you can not edit PBI file after connecting to a dataset:
- Open new PBI Desktop file -> get data from dataset -> you can copy header, filters, template visualizations from PBI Template (if they are not working, don't worry, they will work in PBI service) -> publish PBI file into Workspace where this model is located (not necessary there) -> edit PBI file in PBI service (you must not publish Desktop file after editing this file in PBI service, because changes will not be saved) -> for safety: after making big changes in PBI service, download PBI file from service and save it on Google Drive
