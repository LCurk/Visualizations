First: build prototype of the dashboard without worrying about the content of the boxes

Steps:
1. Horizontal and vertical alignment (without lines)
	- Instead of lines use white space: two blocks of visualizations with white space in the middle (blank space is not “nothing”, it is a separation between visuals)
2. Help yourself with drawing boxes around each visualization
	- If they belong to the same box, they need to be aligned
	- View -> Gridlines
	- View -> Snap to grid -> Select 2 elements (first element is a reference point) -> Format -> Alling
	- Resize them to be the same size
		- Manually
		- Click on visualization -> Visualizations -> Format
3. Check alignment with visualization [Chart Placeholder by OKViz](https://addljsi.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/opr/Shared%20Documents/04%20OPR%20Stebri/02%20BA/Visualization/SqlBI%20Guidelines/%5Bcourse%5D%20Dashboard%20Design/Visualizations%20to%20upload%20in%20PBI/chartPlaceholderByOKViz-1.0.0.pbiviz?csf=1&web=1&e=7KmAuq)
	- Original configuration will be saved (you can save here your original visualization type and name)
