#### ETL Layer

This is Power Query in a browser.

Is based on Power Query technology:
- Connecting to a data source
- Cleaning and preparing the data
- Merging and combining files

Technologies:
- Power BI service (dataflows editor)
- Power BI Desktop
	- To add data sources
		- You lose the ability to add additional data sources (not if adding dataflow after other data sources)
	- To make additional changes
		- To make changes on dataset after publishing it in Power BI service

Benefits of using dataflows
- It makes it a lot easier for people to collaborate inside the same organization on those dataflows (changes in the cloud automatically flow down to datasets and reports that use those dataflows)
