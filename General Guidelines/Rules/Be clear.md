Attach a legend to explain colors if it is not clear from the context.
- Coloring information that should be immediately visible
- Use different shade of grey instead of different colors

Use titles for graphs
- E.g.: Revenue, Gross Profit, Top Selling Products

Don’t use too advance abbreviations
- If using them, explain them

Use the same naming across the whole dashboard
- If there is a title “Gross Profit” on one graph, you shouldn't use “GP” on the other graph
