The monthly chart is too stretched out and too narrow.
- IBCS recommendations give us several options but the best approach is probably a **waterfall chart** that quickly shows variances and contributions to the overall result.

The spaghetti chart (1 line chart for 10 categories)
- Instead of having a single line chart with lines that are crossing each other making things unreadable, we will switch it to the Zebra BI chart. This will give us nine different charts, each showing individual values.
